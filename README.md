##### description about me:
I'm a programmer, photographer that learned most of the basics with no one help and experiments.  
Everything started in 2019, when I watched a video called 'computer pranks for your friends' or something like that.  
And there were two .bat scripts and one 1 .vbs script (thats the how I it remember, even video name VERY LIKELY NOT SAME AS IN THIS DESC. Atlest many of that was in Russian language)  
Then in summer of 2019 I started my .NET Framework adventure. And thats the story

##### who i am now:
Now I'm a more of a backend developer than full-stack, if we talk about my web knowledge. I worked a little bit in Unity game engine.  
Some time before, I thinked, that .NET is best for Windows applications. Now I do not think like that. Now for me best is pure C language, because it's more universal.
